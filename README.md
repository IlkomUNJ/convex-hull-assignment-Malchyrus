# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this. 

i use both chatgpt and gemini to clear this task to help me get started with using qt, like how different is the syntax and what makes qt different between other editor.
this is example of my prompt in using ai :
1. Im using Computational Geometry Third Edition book by mark d berg, help me understand this algorithm for slowconvexhull and give me step by step on how to make it in Qt with cpp
2. How do i create or draw a dot
3. How to create a button and give it function in qt
4. What does this error mean? (with a photo)
etc

i also used ai to help me understand how the syntax work and check how my code is looking is it better although it always said the code can be better if ... but i always ask if the change is needed and what will it change
# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

I asked my friend my friend Derik Navino to help me understand some of the syntax and ask if he knows some of my error before i ask AI
